# Example: Saving Tomato Seeds

This example walks through the complete process of saving tomato seeds from harvest to storage.

## Scenario

You have a healthy 'Cherokee Purple' tomato plant that produced excellent fruit with great flavor. You want to save seeds to grow this variety next year and share with friends.

## Step 1: Select Best Fruits

1. **Choose the best plants** - Select the healthiest, most vigorous plants with the best fruit quality
2. **Mark for seed saving** - Tag or flag the best fruits on the plant
3. **Allow full ripening** - Let fruits become fully ripe, even slightly overripe

**Why?** Seeds from the best fruits will produce plants with the best characteristics.

## Step 2: Harvest Fruits

1. **Harvest when fully ripe** - Fruit should be soft and fully colored
2. **Avoid diseased fruits** - Only save from healthy plants
3. **Check for cracks or damage** - Damaged fruits may have compromised seeds

**Example:** Harvest 3-5 Cherokee Purple tomatoes that are deep purple and slightly soft to the touch.

## Step 3: Extract Seeds

1. **Cut tomato open** - Slice tomato in half horizontally
2. **Scoop out seeds** - Use a spoon to scoop seeds and gel into a clean container
3. **Add water** - Add about 1/2 cup of water to help fermentation

**Container options:**
- Glass jar
- Plastic cup
- Yogurt container (clean)
- Mason jar

**Example:** Scoop seeds from 3 tomatoes into a clean glass jar. Add water until jar is half full.

## Step 4: Ferment Seeds (3-5 Days)

1. **Cover loosely** - Use paper towel or coffee filter to allow gas exchange
2. **Place in warm location** - Room temperature (70-75°F / 21-24°C)
3. **Stir daily** - Stir gently to separate seeds from gel coating
4. **Watch for mold** - White mold on top is normal
5. **Test readiness** - After 2-3 days, stir - if seeds sink, they're ready

**Why ferment?**
- Removes gel coating that inhibits germination
- Kills some seed-borne diseases
- Helps separate viable seeds (sink) from non-viable (float)

**Example:** Place jar on kitchen counter. Stir once a day. After 3 days, stir and observe - most seeds have sunk to bottom.

## Step 5: Clean Seeds

1. **Pour off top layer** - Remove mold, pulp, and floating seeds
2. **Add fresh water** - Rinse seeds several times
3. **Strain seeds** - Pour through mesh strainer or fine screen
4. **Spread to dry** - Place seeds on paper plate or paper towel

**Drying surfaces:**
- Paper plate (best - absorbs moisture)
- Paper towel
- Coffee filter
- Wax paper (use non-stick)

**Example:** Pour off moldy top layer. Add clean water, stir, let settle, pour off. Repeat 3 times. Strain seeds, spread on paper plate in single layer.

## Step 6: Dry Seeds (7-14 Days)

1. **Label with variety** - Write variety name and date on drying surface
2. **Place in warm, dry location** - Out of direct sunlight
3. **Turn seeds daily** - Prevent mold and ensure even drying
4. **Check dryness** - Seeds should snap when bent, not bend or crush

**Drying locations:**
- Kitchen counter (away from stove/sink)
- Shelf in warm room
- Food dehydrator on lowest setting (95°F / 35°C)

**Example:** Label paper plate "Cherokee Purple - 2025". Place on kitchen counter. Turn seeds daily. After 10 days, test - seeds snap when bent.

## Step 7: Test Germination (Optional)

1. **Place 10 seeds** - On damp paper towel
2. **Roll and place in bag** - Not sealed tight
3. **Wait 7-10 days** - Keep at room temperature
4. **Count sprouted seeds** - Calculate germination percentage

**Example:** Place 10 seeds on damp paper towel, roll, place in plastic bag. After 8 days, 9 seeds have sprouted = 90% germination rate.

## Step 8: Store Seeds

1. **Choose container** - Glass jar with tight lid is best
2. **Add desiccant** - Silica gel packet helps control moisture
3. **Label completely** - Include variety, year, germination rate
4. **Store in cool, dark, dry place** - Refrigerator or cool basement

**Storage containers:**
- Glass jar with metal lid (best)
- Mason jar
- Small glass spice jar
- Envelope with silica packet (shorter term)

**Storage locations:**
- Refrigerator (40°F / 5°C) - ideal for most seeds
- Freezer (0°F / -18°C) - excellent for long-term
- Cool basement (50-60°F / 10-15°C) - acceptable for 1-2 years

**Example:** Place seeds in small glass jar with silica gel packet. Label jar:
- Variety: Cherokee Purple
- Year: 2025
- Germination: 90%
- Source: My garden

Store in refrigerator vegetable drawer.

## Step 9: Record in Database

Run seed manager to record inventory:

```bash
python3 scripts/seed_manager.py add
```

Enter:
- Variety: Cherokee Purple
- Crop type: tomato
- Year saved: 2025
- Source: my garden
- Quantity: 3g
- Location: refrigerator
- Container: glass jar
- Notes: Excellent flavor, 90% germination tested

## Tips for Success

✓ **Save from multiple plants** - 6-12 plants for good genetic diversity
✓ **Save multiple fruits** - 3-5 fruits per variety minimum
✓ **Allow full maturity** - Seeds from fully ripe fruits are most viable
✓ **Ferment properly** - Don't skip fermentation for tomatoes
✓ **Dry thoroughly** - Moisture is the enemy of seed longevity
✓ **Label everything** - You'll forget variety names otherwise
✓ **Test germination** - Especially important for older seeds
✓ **Store cool and dry** - Ideal conditions for maximum longevity

## Common Problems

**Seeds mold during drying:**
- Not dried thoroughly enough
- Too humid in drying location
- Solution: Dry longer, use dehydrator

**Low germination rate:**
- Seeds saved from immature fruit
- Improper fermentation
- Stored in warm, humid conditions
- Solution: Save from fully ripe fruit, ferment properly, store cool and dry

**Variety doesn't breed true next year:**
- Cross-pollinated with other tomato varieties
- Was actually an F1 hybrid (not open-pollinated)
- Solution: Ensure variety is open-pollinated, maintain 25-foot isolation

## Timeline

| 0 | Extract seeds, begin fermentation |
| 1-3 | Stir fermentation mixture daily |
| 3 | Clean and rinse seeds, spread to dry |
| 4-14 | Turn seeds daily, allow to dry |
| 10-14 | Test dryness, check that seeds snap |
| 15 | Test germination (optional) |
| 15 | Package seeds for storage |
| 15 | Store in cool, dark location |

## Expected Yield

From 3 Cherokee Purple tomatoes:
- Extract: ~200-300 seeds
- After cleaning: ~150-250 viable seeds
- After storage: 80-90% viability = 120-225 seeds
- Planting rate: 20-30 seeds for 10 plants

## Record Keeping

Maintain a seed saving journal:

```

Variety: Cherokee Purple
Source: Seed Savers Exchange (original), my garden (saved)
Number of plants: 12
Number of fruits saved: 5
Seeds harvested: ~250
Fermentation days: 3
Drying days: 10

## Sharing Seeds

After saving seeds, share with friends and community:

- **Seed swaps** - Bring to local seed exchange events
- **Community seed library** - Donate to public library seed program
- **Friends and neighbors** - Share with fellow gardeners
- **Online exchanges** - Participate in seed swap forums

When sharing, always include:
- Variety name
- Year saved
- Germination rate (if tested)
- Brief growing notes
- Any known characteristics (flavor, disease resistance, etc.)
