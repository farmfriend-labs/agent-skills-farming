# Seed Sovereignty Guide

Empowers small farmers and homesteaders to save, select, and store their own seeds for true food independence and resilience.

## Purpose

Break dependence on commercial seed companies by enabling farmers to save their own seeds, select for their specific growing conditions, and build resilient seed banks adapted to local climates and practices. Returns control of the food system to those who grow the food.

## Problem Solved

Commercial seeds cost $50-$500 per acre annually for hybrid and patented varieties. Seed companies prioritize traits for industrial agriculture (uniform harvest, shipping tolerance) rather than nutrition, flavor, or resilience. Farmers buying seeds each season lose the ability to adapt varieties to their microclimate and soil conditions. Patent restrictions prevent saving seeds from F1 hybrids and protected varieties, creating perpetual dependency on seed corporations.

### Seed Processing Techniques

#### Wet Processing (for fruits and fleshy vegetables)

1. **Fermentation Method** (tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, melons)
   - Scoop seeds into container with some pulp
   - Add small amount of water, cover loosely
   - Let ferment 2-5 days at room temperature
   - Stir daily to release seeds
   - When good seeds sink and bad float, pour off top
   - Rinse thoroughly, spread to dry

2. **Water Separation** (peppers, eggplant)
   - Place seeds in water bowl
   - Viable seeds sink, non-viable float
   - Pour off floating debris
   - Rinse and dry viable seeds

3. **Rinsing Only** (pumpkins, some squash)
   - Rinse seeds to remove pulp
   - Spread on screens to dry
   - Turn seeds daily to prevent mold

#### Dry Processing (for dry pods and seedheads)

1. **Threshing** (beans, peas, grains)
   - Place dry pods in bag
   - Crush or stomp to release seeds
   - Remove large debris by hand

2. **Winnowing** (all dry seeds)
   - Pour seeds between containers in gentle breeze
   - Light chaff blows away, heavy seeds fall
   - Repeat until clean

3. **Screening** (small seeds like lettuce, carrots)
   - Use mesh screens of appropriate size
   - Larger debris caught by screen
   - Small seeds pass through

#### Drying Seeds

**Target Moisture Content**: 8-12% for most vegetables, 10-14% for grains

**Drying Methods**:
- Air drying on paper towels or screens (7-14 days)
- Food dehydrator at 95°F (35°C) for 6-12 hours
- Silica gel desiccant for final moisture reduction
- Avoid oven drying (too hot, kills seeds)

**Testing Dryness**:
- Seeds should snap when bent (not bend or crush)
- Seeds shouldn't stick to hands or containers
- Large seeds should have visible cracks when cut

### Storage Guidelines

#### Temperature and Humidity

**Ideal Conditions**:
- Temperature: 40-50°F (5-10°C)
- Relative humidity: 40-60%
- Dark environment (no direct light)
- Consistent conditions (avoid fluctuations)

**Storage Locations**:
- Root cellar or basement (good temp, watch humidity)
- Refrigerator (good temp, monitor for moisture)
- Freezer (excellent for long-term, must be very dry)
- Cool pantry shelf (acceptable for short-term, 1-2 years)

#### Containers

**Best Options**:
- Glass jars with metal lids (airtight)
- Mylar bags with oxygen absorbers
- Food-grade plastic buckets with gamma seals
- Vacuum-sealed bags

**Labeling Requirements**:
- Variety name
- Year saved
- Germination percentage (if tested)
- Source (your garden or exchange)
- Special notes (drought resistant, early maturing, etc.)

#### Longevity Estimates

When stored under ideal conditions:
- Tomatoes: 4-6 years
- Beans: 3-4 years
- Peas: 3-4 years
- Corn: 1-2 years
- Squash: 4-6 years
- Cucumbers: 5-10 years
- Lettuce: 2-3 years
- Peppers: 2-4 years
- Brassicas: 4-5 years
- Onions: 1-2 years
- Beets: 4-6 years
- Carrots: 3-5 years

### Germination Testing

**Simple Germination Test**:

1. Place 10-25 seeds on damp paper towel
2. Roll towel and place in plastic bag (not sealed tight)
3. Keep at room temperature (65-75°F / 18-24°C)
4. Check daily, keep moist but not soaking
5. Count sprouted seeds after 7-14 days (crop dependent)
6. Calculate germination rate: (sprouted / total) × 100

**Interpreting Results**:
- 90%+: Excellent, plant normally
- 75-90%: Good, increase seeding rate slightly
- 50-75%: Fair, plant thicker, consider fresh seed
- Below 50%: Poor, replace seed or use for replanting only

**Record Keeping**:
- Test date
- Seed lot (variety, year)
- Germination rate
- Conditions used (temperature, medium)
- Notes on seedling vigor

### Genetic Diversity Management

**Minimum Population Sizes**:

**Self-pollinating**: 10-20 plants minimum for diversity
**Cross-pollinating**: 20-100+ plants depending on crop
**Biennial**: 20-50+ plants to maintain diversity over 2 years

**Genetic Bottlenecks**:
- Avoid saving seeds from fewer than 10 plants (most crops)
- For corn and brassicas, 50+ plants recommended
- Rotate between different parent plants each year
- Introduce new genetics periodically via seed exchange

**Maintaining Diversity**:
1. Save seeds from multiple plants, not just the "best" single plant
2. Include some variation in your selections (early, late, different sizes)
3. Keep seeds from plants that performed well under stress
4. Document each seed batch's parent population

**Signs of Inbreeding Depression**:
- Reduced germination rates
- Lower vigor and growth rates
- Increased susceptibility to disease
- Poor yields
- Variable plant characteristics

### Selecting Plants for Seed Saving

**What to Look For**:
- True-to-type characteristics (matches variety description)
- Vigorous growth and health
- Good yield and fruit quality
- Resistance to local pests/diseases
- Adaptation to your growing conditions
- Desirable characteristics (early maturity, drought tolerance, etc.)

**What to Avoid**:
- Off-type plants (mutations or crosses)
- Diseased or pest-damaged plants
- Plants that bolted prematurely (bolting = going to seed early)
- Weak or stunted plants
- Plants with poor fruit quality

**Roguing**:
- Mark and remove undesirable plants before they flower
- For cross-pollinators, rogue before flowering to prevent pollen contamination
- For self-pollinators, can rogue before seed harvest
- Keep records of rogued plants for future reference

### Climate Adaptation

**Selecting for Local Conditions**:

**Heat Tolerance**:
- Save seeds from plants that thrived during heat waves
- Look for varieties that set fruit during hot periods
- Select for plants that didn't drop blossoms in heat
- Gradually shift varieties toward heat adaptation over 3-5 seasons

**Cold Tolerance**:
- Save seeds from plants that survived late frosts
- Select varieties that mature before early frost
- Look for plants that kept producing through cold snaps
- Test early and late plantings to identify cold-tolerant strains

**Drought Resistance**:
- Save seeds from plants that thrived during dry periods
- Select for varieties with deep roots or water-efficient growth
- Look for plants that maintained yield with less water
- Gradually adapt varieties to low-water conditions

**Pest Resistance**:
- Save seeds from plants that showed pest damage resistance
- Select for varieties that attracted fewer pests
- Document pest pressures each season
- Breed for resistance to your specific pest challenges

**Disease Resistance**:
- Save seeds from healthy plants during disease outbreaks
- Select varieties that showed less disease severity
- Document disease pressures annually
- Rotate varieties to maintain genetic diversity

### Legal Considerations

#### Seed Patents and Restrictions

**F1 Hybrids**:
- Cannot save viable seeds (second generation doesn't breed true)
- Legal to save but impractical (results are unpredictable)
- Most commercial vegetables are F1 hybrids

**Patented Varieties**:
- Many commercial varieties have plant patents
- Illegal to propagate patented varieties without permission
- Look for "Patent Pending" or patent number on seed packets
- Open-pollinated and heirloom varieties are generally safe

**Plant Variety Protection (PVP)**:
- Some varieties have PVP certificates
- Farmers have exemption for saving seeds for their own use (US)
- Cannot sell saved seeds from PVP-protected varieties
- Check variety database for PVP status

#### Farmer Exemptions (United States)

**Legal to Save Seeds From**:
- Open-pollinated varieties
- Heirloom varieties
- PVP-protected varieties (for personal use only)
- Unpatented varieties

**Restricted**:
- Patented varieties (without permission)
- Selling saved seeds from PVP-protected varieties
- Propagating trademarked varieties with protected name

#### Organic Certification

**Allowed**:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Moldy seeds during storage**:
- Seeds were not dried sufficiently
- Storage humidity too high
- Container not airtight
- Solution: Dry thoroughly, check humidity, use better containers

**Low germination rates**:
- Seeds too old (past viability window)
- Stored in warm conditions
- Improper drying before storage
- Solution: Test regularly, store cool and dry, replace old seeds

**Varieties crossed (off-type plants)**:
- Insufficient isolation distance
- Bees carrying pollen between varieties
- Solution: Increase isolation, use bagging or hand pollination

**Plants bolting prematurely**:
- Weather stress (heat or cold)
- Planting too early or late
- Variety not suited to climate
- Solution: Adjust planting times, select adapted varieties

**Seedlings weak or stunted**:
- Poor seed quality or low vitality
- Germination conditions suboptimal
- Soil or fertility issues
- Solution: Test seed quality, improve germination conditions, check soil health

**Seeds not setting (no seed production)**:
- Poor pollination (lack of pollinators or isolation)
- Weather too hot/cold during flowering
- Plant stress (drought, nutrient deficiency)
- Solution: Improve pollination, protect from weather stress, reduce plant stress
