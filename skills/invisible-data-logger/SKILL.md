# Invisible Data Logger

Log farm data without expensive proprietary equipment.

## Purpose

Data logging requires expensive equipment: John Deere GS3 display ($3000), Trimble displays ($5000+), Precision Planting monitors ($2500+), cloud subscriptions ($500+/year). Small farmers can't afford data logging. This skill provides low-cost data logging alternatives.
