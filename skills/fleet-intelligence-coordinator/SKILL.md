# Fleet Intelligence Coordinator

Coordinate mixed-brand equipment fleet operations for optimal efficiency and utilization.

## Purpose

Mixed-brand fleets create coordination challenges: John Deere tractors with Case IH planters, AGCO sprayers with precision systems from different vendors. Each brand's software is siloed, making fleet-wide optimization impossible. This skill provides unified fleet intelligence across all equipment brands, enabling optimal scheduling, routing, and resource allocation regardless of manufacturer.
