# Safety Guidelines for Emergency Diagnostics

## Critical Safety Rules

### 1. Never Override Safety-Critical Systems

**Rule:** Never disable, bypass, or modify safety-critical functions.

**Safety-critical codes include:**
- Brake system failures (SPN 597 FMI 0/1)
- Engine oil pressure critically low (SPN 100 FMI 1)
- Engine coolant temperature critically high (SPN 91 FMI 0)
- Steering system failures
- Fire system faults

**What this means:**
- Do not attempt to clear these codes without professional repair
- Stop operation immediately when these codes appear
- Contact dealer or qualified service provider
- Do not attempt DIY repairs on safety systems

### 2. Confirm Equipment is Safe Before Clearing Codes

**Rule:** Only clear codes after confirming the underlying issue is resolved.

**Clearing code checklist:**
- [ ] Root cause identified and addressed
- [ ] Repair completed and verified
- [ ] Equipment tested in safe environment
- [ ] No safety concerns remain
- [ ] Professional service not required

**Never clear codes when:**
- Problem is not understood
- Repair is incomplete
- Safety is compromised
- Code is critical severity

### 3. Respect Manufacturer Safety Systems

**Rule:** Do not attempt to override manufacturer safety features.

**Examples of systems to respect:**
- Emergency stop circuits
- Overspeed protection
- Overheat shutdown systems
- ROPS (Roll Over Protective Structure) monitoring
- Fire suppression systems

**Why this matters:**
- These systems are designed for operator safety
- Bypassing them creates life-threatening hazards
- Warranty may be voided
- Legal liability increases

### 4. Stop Operation for Critical Codes

**Rule:** Immediately stop equipment operation when critical codes appear.

**Critical code indicators:**
- Red warning lights
- Audible alarms
- "STOP" messages on display
- Critical severity codes (Level 1)

**What to do:**
1. Safely stop equipment
2. Move to a safe location if possible
3. Engage parking brake
4. Shut down engine if safe to do so
5. Contact professional service

### 5. Use Professional Service When Required

**Rule:** Recognize when a problem requires professional expertise.

**Situations requiring professional service:**
- Safety-critical codes
- ECU reprogramming needs
- Complex hydraulic repairs
- Electrical system diagnosis
- Emissions system repairs
- Transmission repairs
- Any situation beyond your capability

**When in doubt, call a professional.**

## Equipment Safety Precautions

### Before Connecting Diagnostic Equipment

1. **Park on level ground**
   - Ensure equipment won't roll
   - Engage parking brake
   - Chock wheels if necessary

2. **Shut down engine** (unless live monitoring requires running engine)
   - Turn off ignition
   - Remove keys
   - Wait for rotating parts to stop

3. **Verify PTO is disengaged**
   - Ensure power take-off is off
   - Confirm implements are disengaged
   - Check hydraulic controls are neutral

4. **Block moving parts** if working near them
   - Use blocks to prevent unexpected movement
   - Tag out energy sources if possible

5. **Allow equipment to cool** if recently operated
   - Avoid burns from hot surfaces
   - Let fluids settle

### During Diagnostic Sessions

1. **Stay clear of moving parts**
   - Keep hands, tools, and clothing away from rotating components
   - Use caution around belts, pulleys, and shafts

2. **Never bypass safety guards**
   - Keep guards in place
   - Do not remove protective covers

3. **Use insulated tools** around electrical systems
   - Prevent short circuits
   - Avoid electrical shock

4. **Keep fire extinguisher nearby**
   - Class ABC for general use
   - Class D for metal fires (if applicable)

5. **Work in well-ventilated areas**
   - Especially important when engine is running
   - Avoid carbon monoxide buildup

### After Diagnostics

1. **Disconnect diagnostic equipment**
   - Unplug adapters before starting equipment
   - Secure wiring away from moving parts

2. **Remove tools and equipment**
   - Clear work area
   - Ensure nothing will fall into moving parts

3. **Verify all safety systems are engaged**
   - Check brake operation
   - Verify guards are in place
   - Confirm warning lights are operational

4. **Start engine in neutral**
   - Ensure transmission is in park/neutral
   - Keep clear of equipment when starting

## Electrical Safety

### When Working with Electrical Systems

1. **Disconnect battery** before working on electrical components
   - Disconnect negative terminal first
   - Reconnect negative terminal last
   - Use insulated tools

2. **Capacitor discharge**
   - Some ECUs have capacitors that store charge
   - Wait recommended time after power off
   - Consult service manual for specific equipment

3. **Avoid short circuits**
   - Use insulated probes
   - Be careful with multimeter leads
   - Never bridge terminals with conductive material

4. **Grounding**
   - Ensure proper grounding of diagnostic equipment
   - Avoid ground loops
   - Connect to manufacturer-specified ground points

5. **Static electricity**
   - Ground yourself before touching ECUs
   - Use anti-static precautions when handling electronic components

## Chemical Safety

### Fluid Handling

1. **Know your fluids**
   - Engine oil, hydraulic fluid, coolant, fuel, DEF
   - Check Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)
   - Use appropriate containers

2. **Wear appropriate PPE**
   - Gloves (chemical-resistant when needed)
   - Safety glasses
   - Protective clothing

3. **Contain spills**
   - Use drip pans
   - Have absorbent material ready
   - Follow environmental regulations for disposal

4. **Avoid skin contact**
   - Some fluids can cause irritation or chemical burns
   - Wash thoroughly if contact occurs
   - Seek medical attention if symptoms develop

## Environmental Safety

### Diagnostics in Field Conditions

1. **Weather considerations**
   - Avoid working in severe weather
   - Use caution in rain (electrical hazards)
   - Be aware of heat exhaustion risks

2. **Terrain awareness**
   - Stable footing
   - Watch for slip hazards
   - Be aware of slope stability

3. **Wildlife awareness**

   - Snakes in tall grass

## Legal and Liability Considerations

### Documentation Requirements

1. **Keep detailed records**
   - Timestamp all diagnostic sessions
   - Document codes found
   - Record actions taken
   - Note equipment information (make, model, VIN)

2. **Preserve evidence**
   - Save diagnostic reports
   - Photograph damage or problems
   - Record sensor data readings

3. **Warranty preservation**
   - Document all maintenance
   - Keep receipts for parts
