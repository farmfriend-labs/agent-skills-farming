# Actionable Weather Alerts

Weather alerts with specific, actionable recommendations for farm operations.

## Purpose

Generic weather alerts are useless: 'Chance of rain' with no operational guidance, 'Freeze warning' with no protection recommendations, 'High wind advisory' with no impact assessment. Farmers need specific actions: 'Cancel spray application, rain in 3 hours', 'Protect citrus trees, freeze tonight at 28F'. This skill provides actionable weather intelligence.
