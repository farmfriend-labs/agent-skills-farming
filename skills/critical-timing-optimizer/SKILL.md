# Critical Timing Optimizer

Optimize critical operations timing for weather conditions and operational efficiency.

## Purpose

Timing is everything in agriculture: planting windows of 2-3 days, harvest windows of 5-7 days, spray application windows of 1-2 days before rain. Missing these windows costs thousands in yield and quality. Weather forecasts are unreliable and operational factors compound the challenge. This skill optimizes timing across all operations based on multiple data sources.
