# One Screen Mission Control

Single-screen operations control center providing real-time farm status, alerts, and actionable intelligence.

## Purpose

Create a centralized dashboard that displays all critical farm operations information on a single screen. Monitor equipment status, field conditions, weather, tasks, and alerts in real-time without switching between multiple applications or proprietary systems. Make informed decisions quickly with all relevant data visible at once.

## Problem Solved

Farmers operate with fragmented information spread across multiple sources:
- Equipment manufacturer apps (JD Operations Center, Case AFS, etc.)
- Weather apps and websites
- Spreadsheets for planning and tracking
- Paper notes and notebooks
- Text messages and phone calls from workers
- Email from suppliers and buyers
- Multiple software subscriptions requiring separate logins

This fragmentation causes:
- Constant context switching during busy seasons
- Missed alerts or important information
- Difficulty seeing the "big picture"
- Time wasted checking multiple systems
- Inability to respond quickly to changing conditions
- Lack of coordinated decision-making

One Screen Mission Control consolidates all critical information into a single, customizable dashboard.

**Solutions:**
- Disable non-essential zones
- Increase refresh intervals
- Add database indexes
- Optimize queries

## Testing

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test data source connections
   - Verify alert triggers
   - Test quick actions
   - Validate data display

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test all data sources together
   - Verify real-time updates
   - Test alert notifications
   - Check dashboard performance

3. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - Test with realistic data
